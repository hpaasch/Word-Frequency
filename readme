Joel,

I tried to collaborate with different people today, partly for the heck of it,
partly to be inclusive and partly to be able to focus more on my own thinking.

I'm here later, but I got all the way through.

Rayn helped me think about the buffer, and it was much easier than I was trying
to make it.

The last thing I did was import sys and use argv to require a filename to be
input on the command line. I think it works as expected. I get an index error
in the IDE, but it doesn't error out on the terminal. If I did it wrong, I left
in a commented out line that sets the filename = sampletext.txt. It can be
restored to run the program.

Word_frequency.py is the Normal Mode homework.
word_frequency.py is the Hard Mode homework.
(Sorry for the capitalization inconsistency. I probably need to learn how to
rename files to fix dumb things like that.)

Hope
